Deadline day - end of project

## 2020-02-25
There isn't much left to do so today is going to be spent finishing things up and making sure
everything is in order for the deadline (tomorrow night).

## 2020-02-24 (V2)
After doing some research I've come to find out that the HaveIBeenPwned API has a fee of
$3.50/month which in this case (educational) is not worth it, I am therefore going to switch to another API, the NASA API which can be used to fetch space images & videos.

I've been a bit lackluster in terms of documenting my process but here's the summary the past few days;
I've changed my Auth API provider from Okta to Firebase due to it being much more simple and having well-written docs.
The login/account page is essentially completed in terms of authentication functionality, it is however lacking in regards
to the information that is shown to the logged in user, I have yet to do add the RestAPI calls.
I have also updated/redesigned the overall layout and graphics of the website.

That brings us to todays subject where I will be doing just that, fetching information from a third-party API.
The API in which I have decided to use is the "Have I Been Pwned" whichs provides data regarding hacked emails and such.

## 2020-02-20
Beginning implementation of the API calls and also showcasing the received information in the "logged in state"

## 2020-02-18
Continuing on from yesterday but focusing more on the signing up aspect of the account and also the "logged in/welcome" page

## 2020-02-17
The goal of today is to lightly start implementing the account/login functionality

## 2021-02-15
Going to setup the basics of the project i.e planning ahead, setting up a basic HTML/CSS page and getting everything running smoothly to prevent any problems in the future.
